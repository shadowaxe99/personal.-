# Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategies and procedures for Michael Gruen's website. The testing process is an integral part of our development lifecycle to ensure a robust and user-friendly platform that caters to a diverse audience. Our testing approach includes unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests to cover all aspects of the application.

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing of JavaScript and TypeScript components.
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components in a way that resembles how users interact with the application.
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing to simulate real user scenarios.
- **Postman**: For testing and documenting the API endpoints.

## Unit Testing

Unit tests are written to ensure that individual components and functions behave as expected. Each React component and utility function will have associated test cases.

### Example

```javascript
// src/components/Biography.test.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Biography from './Biography';

test('renders Biography component', () => {
  render(<Biography />);
  expect(screen.getByTestId('biography')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work together as intended. This includes testing the interaction between components, as well as the integration with the backend API.

### Example

```javascript
// src/components/App.test.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from '../App';

test('renders App and checks navigation', () => {
  render(<App />);
  expect(screen.getByTestId('main-nav')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByTestId('footer-nav')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

UAT involves beta testers to validate the user experience against requirements. Testers from our target audience will be recruited to provide feedback on the usability and functionality of the website.

### UAT Scenarios

- Navigating through the Biography and Portfolio sections.
- Interacting with the Media Appearances gallery.
- Signing up for Mentorship Programs.
- Engaging with the Community Forum.
- Subscribing to Exclusive Content.

## End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios from start to finish. Cypress will be used to automate these tests.

### Example

```javascript
// cypress/integration/subscription_flow.spec.js
describe('Subscription Flow', () => {
  it('allows a user to subscribe to exclusive content', () => {
    cy.visit('/subscription');
    cy.get('#subscription-form').within(() => {
      cy.get('input[name="email"]').type('user@example.com');
      cy.root().submit();
    });
    cy.contains('Thank you for subscribing!');
  });
});

```

## API Testing

API endpoints will be tested to ensure they respond correctly to various requests and handle errors gracefully.

### Example

```javascript
// Using Postman to test the Biography API endpoint
GET /api/biography
Response: 200 OK
Body: {
  "name": "Michael Gruen",
  "achievements": [...]
}
```

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

Our CI/CD pipeline includes running tests on every commit to the repository. GitHub Actions will be configured to automate this process.

### GitHub Actions Configuration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run Tests
      run: npm test
```

## Test Coverage

We aim for a high level of test coverage to ensure confidence in the application's stability and quality. Coverage reports will be generated after each test run.

### Generating Coverage Report

```shell
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Reporting Bugs and Issues

Any bugs or issues discovered during testing should be reported using the GitHub Issues tracker. A template will be provided to ensure all necessary information is included.

## Conclusion

Thorough testing is crucial for delivering a high-quality product. This document will be updated as the testing strategy evolves throughout the development process.
