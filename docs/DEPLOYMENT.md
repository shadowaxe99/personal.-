# Deployment Guide

This document outlines the steps required to deploy Michael Gruen's website to a production environment. The deployment process includes setting up the server, deploying the code, and ensuring that all services are running correctly.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the deployment, ensure that you have the following:

- Access to a cloud hosting provider (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your local machine for testing.
- Access to the repository containing the website's code.
- Necessary credentials for accessing the database and other external services.

## Steps for Deployment

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine or directly to the server where you will be deploying the application.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/michael-gruen-website.git
cd michael-gruen-website
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Copy the `.env.example` file to create a `.env` file that will store your production environment variables.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to include the correct values for your production environment.

### 3. Build the Docker Containers

Use Docker Compose to build the application and its services.

```
docker-compose build
```

### 4. Run the Containers

Start the containers using Docker Compose.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

### 5. Database Setup

Run any necessary database migrations and seed the database with initial data if required.

```
docker-compose exec server node server/config/database.js
```

### 6. Verify Deployment

Check that the application is running by accessing the public IP or domain of your server.

### 7. Set Up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate future deployments. The configuration for this will depend on your chosen tool.

### 8. Monitoring and Logging

Set up monitoring and logging tools such as New Relic or Datadog to keep track of the application's performance and health.

### 9. SSL Certificate

Ensure that an SSL certificate is installed and configured for HTTPS connections.

### 10. Compliance Checks

Perform a final check to ensure that the application complies with GDPR and other relevant data protection laws.

## Post-Deployment

After the application is deployed, perform the following:

- Monitor the server and application logs for any unusual activity.
- Regularly update the application and its dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Engage in performance tuning based on the insights gathered from monitoring tools.

## Rollback Procedure

In case of a deployment failure or critical issue, follow these steps to rollback to the previous stable version:

1. Identify the last stable release in the repository.
2. Revert the code to the stable release using Git.
3. Rebuild and redeploy the Docker containers.
4. Verify that the rollback was successful.

## Additional Notes

- The deployment process may vary slightly depending on the specific configurations of the cloud provider and other services used.
- Always ensure that backups are taken before deployment, especially for the database.
- Regularly review security settings and access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
