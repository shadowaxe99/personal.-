# Internationalization (i18n) Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for implementing internationalization (i18n) on Michael Gruen's website. The goal is to make the website accessible and user-friendly to a global audience, catering to our diverse target audience that ranges from business professionals to aspiring influencers.

## Objectives

- Provide localized content to enhance user experience.
- Support multiple languages to cater to a global audience.
- Ensure that the design and layout of the website accommodate different languages without breaking the user interface.

## Implementation

### Language Selection

- A language selector will be available in the header of the website, allowing users to choose their preferred language.
- The selected language preference will be saved in the user's local storage for future visits.

### React Internationalization

- We will use the `react-intl` library to provide internationalization support in our React components.
- Messages and labels will be extracted into a messages file for each supported language, e.g., `en.json`, `es.json`, etc.

### Directory Structure

- The internationalization files will be stored in a dedicated `i18n` directory within the `src` folder.
- Example: `src/i18n/en.json`, `src/i18n/es.json`

### Integration with CMS

- The headless CMS will support content entry in multiple languages.
- Content managers will be able to provide translations for dynamic content such as blog posts, articles, and resource library entries.

### Date and Currency Formatting

- We will use the `Intl` JavaScript API for formatting dates and currencies based on the user's locale.
- Example: `new Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale).format(date)`

### Right-to-Left (RTL) Support

- For languages that are read from right to left, such as Arabic and Hebrew, we will ensure that the website layout flips accordingly.
- CSS and design elements will be adapted using the `dir` attribute and additional RTL-specific stylesheets if necessary.

### Testing

- Internationalization features will be tested during the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase with the help of multilingual beta testers.
- Automated tests will be written to ensure that language switching functions correctly and that all text is properly localized.

## Supported Languages

Initially, the website will support the following languages:
- English (en)
- Spanish (es)
- Mandarin Chinese (zh)
- French (fr)
- German (de)

Additional languages may be added based on user demand and analytics data.

## Continuous Localization

- As new content is added to the website, it will be localized into the supported languages.
- We will establish a process with our content team to ensure that all new content is available in all supported languages in a timely manner.

## Dependencies

- `react-intl`: For internationalization of React components.
- `i18next`: An i18n framework which can be used in conjunction with `react-intl` for advanced features like pluralization and formatting.
- `react-router`: To handle language-based routing in the application.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing automatic language detection based on the user's browser settings or IP address.
- Adding support for additional languages based on user feedback and site analytics.

## Conclusion

Internationalization is a key component of making Michael Gruen's website globally accessible and user-friendly. By following this strategy, we will provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for all users, regardless of their language or location.
