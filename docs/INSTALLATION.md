# Installation Guide

Welcome to the installation guide for Michael Gruen's comprehensive website. This document will walk you through the steps required to get the website up and running on your local development machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git
- Docker (for containerization)
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., VSCode)

## Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/michael-gruen-website.git
cd michael-gruen-website
```

## Setting Up the Environment

Copy the example environment file and set up your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to include your specific configuration such as database URI, API keys, and other sensitive information.

## Installing Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for both the server and client:

```bash
# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../src
npm install
```

## Database Configuration

Ensure your MongoDB or PostgreSQL database is set up and running. Refer to `server/config/database.js` for database configuration.

## Running the Application

To run the application in development mode, you'll need to start both the server and the client:

```bash
# Start the server
cd server
npm start

# In a new terminal, start the client
cd src
npm start
```

The website should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run the following command in the `src` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with all the optimized production files.

## Docker Containerization

If you prefer to use Docker, you can build and run the application using the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker-compose build

# Run the Docker container
docker-compose up
```
